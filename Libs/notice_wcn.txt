# ldAout.tcl --
#
#	This "tclldAout" procedure in this script acts as a replacement
#	for the "ld" command when linking an object file that will be
#	loaded dynamically into Tcl or Tk using pseudo-static linking.
#
# Parameters:
#	The arguments to the script are the command line options for
#	an "ld" command.
#
# Results:
#	The "ld" command is parsed, and the "-o" option determines the
#	module name.  ".a" and ".o" options are accumulated.
#	The input archives and object files are examined with the "nm"
#	command to determine whether the modules initialization
#	entry and safe initialization entry are present.  A trivial
#	C function that locates the entries is composed, compiled, and
#	its .o file placed before all others in the command; then
#	"ld" is executed to bind the objects together.
